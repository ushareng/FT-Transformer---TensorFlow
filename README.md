# FT-Transformer-TensorFlow

FT-Transformer â€” a simple adaptation of the Transformer architecture for tabular data that becomes a new powerful solution for the field and it performs well on a wider range of tasks than other DL models.

FT Transformers was introduced in the paper " Revisiting Deep Learning for Tabular Data " - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11959.pdf
